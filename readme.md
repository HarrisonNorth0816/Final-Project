# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2023

## Theme
When we thought about the theme, we immediately had two ideas, Inside out, emotions, like the movie. But we also wondered how we could implement that mechanically. Enter the Inverse: A world parrellel to your everyday one, but different in small ways. Throughout our game you will be able to dive into this alternate world of self expression and use it to work through your emotions, all the way to victory. 

## Game Play
Objective
Game-play instructions
Use WASD to navigate a frozen world, discover memories and reflect on your emotions.

## Impediments
We struggled to all use the same repository without the files getting mixed up and with our unique mechanic which allows the switching of the front to back tiles, but with communication and teamwork were able to overcome both!

## Implementation
We created a unique feature which allows the player's screen to shift from one level to a level within a level, both which feature puzzle elements to assist in completion of the game. ALL of the assets were made by us from the music to the character sprites to the UI, code and background.
